Event details

    Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
    Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
    You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

Rules

To get a shirt, you must make four pull requests between October 1–31 in any timezone. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones we’ve highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. Pull requests reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won’t count towards the shirt.
